Email(target)-My spam folder email -->Tutorials Point

High-Level Summary

SPF Pass (aligned)
DKIM: Partially pass (body hash did not verify, domain alignment issue)
DMARC:  Pass (but with p=quarantine)
Delivered: Successfully reached inbox (not marked as spam)
Relay: Fast (0-second delay)
Sending platform: Sendinblue (now Brevo)
DNS provider: Cloudflare


Detailed Analysis

1. SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

Domain: shared-p900-i2.d.sender-sib.com
IP 77.32.170.2 is authorized (passes SPF)
Alignment is OK with the Return-Path and MailFrom domains.
Pass and aligned* – this is good.


2. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

Two DKIM signatures are present:

One from tutorialspoint.com – fails body hash verification
One from mailin.fr (Sendinblue/Brevo) –passes

Issues:

Body hash mismatch (bh doesn't match the actual body content). This could mean:

The email was altered in transit.
There's a bug or misconfiguration in the DKIM signing process.
DKIM domain alignment*: the domain in From: (tutorialspoint.com) does not align with mailin.fr.

Problem: This breaks DMARC alignment unless one DKIM signature aligns or SPF passes.



3.DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)

Policy: p=quarantine; pct=25

 Only 25% of unauthenticated emails are quarantined.
 Because SPF passes and aligns, DMARC passes, despite the DKIM issues.

Passes, but not optimal – full DKIM alignment would improve security.



4. Relay & Delivery Info

Sent via: Sendinblue (shared IP)
Email headers show no significant delay.
Not on any blacklists.
Delivered to Gmail without bounce or quarantine.

Delivered promptly and not flagged as spam

5.Header Anomalies / Observations

The From: and Return-Path: mismatch slightly due to Sendinblue's default handling.
Uses ARC headers (Authenticated Received Chain) – Gmail adds this for extra tracking and trust propagation.
Proper unsubscribe mechanisms are in place (both mailto: and one-click List-Unsubscribe).


 Is This Email Legitimate?

Yes, most likely.Here's why:

Sent through a reputable bulk sender (Sendinblue/Brevo)
SPF passes and aligns
DMARC passes
Domain tutorialspoint.com is legitimate
Links point to real Tutorialspoint domains
Content matches expected marketing from Tutorials Point
 No signs of spoofing/phishing

 Minor Concerns:

DKIM body hash failed verification – this should not happen and could impact deliverability if the DMARC policy were stricter.
DKIM misalignment could also be improved for maximum compliance.


Recommendation (for Tutorials Point or Sender Admins)

If you're managing this domain:

1. Ensure DKIM body hash signs correctly (check email body transformations post-signing).
2. Consider stricter DMARC policy (p=reject) if you fix DKIM issues.
3. Ensure DKIM domain matches the From: domain (alignment).
